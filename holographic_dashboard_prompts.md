- Secondary overlays: 8-12% opacity with subtle blur
- Background layers: 3-5% opacity for depth context
- Active states: 35-45% opacity with enhanced glow
- Critical alerts: 60-80% opacity with pulsing borders

TYPOGRAPHY HIERARCHY:
- Display text: Futuristic sans-serif, thin weight, increased letter spacing
- Interface labels: Clean geometric fonts with subtle glow effects
- Data readouts: Monospace fonts for technical precision
- Body text: High-contrast readable fonts with anti-aliasing

HOLOGRAPHIC COMPONENTS:

- Circular progress indicators with particle trails
- Radial navigation menus with gesture zones
- Data stream visualizations with flowing animations
- Modal overlays that materialize from dimensional rifts
- Notification systems using holographic projections

LIGHTING & EFFECTS:
- Ambient glow emanating from active interface elements
- Subtle particle systems floating in background space
- Dynamic shadow casting from floating panels
- Lens flare effects on critical interaction points
- Depth-of-field blur for non-focused elements
- Chromatic aberration on panel edges for realism

MOTION DESIGN:
- Smooth 300-500ms eased transitions for panel movements
- Elastic scaling for tile interactions (scale 1.05-1.1)
- Floating/bobbing animations for idle states
- Ripple effects propagating from user interactions
- Smooth camera-like perspective shifts for navigation
- Magnetism effects when organizing tile layouts

INTERACTION PATTERNS:
- Hover states trigger gentle glow and lift effects
- Click interactions create expanding ripple animations  
- Drag operations show dimensional depth and positioning guides
- Multi-touch gestures for panel manipulation and scaling
- Voice command integration with visual feedback systems
- Eye-tracking simulation for attention-based highlights
